# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. The priority of the patch release is dependent on the score given the vulnerability via the CVSS v3.0 Rating system.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to **[security@mailejoe.io](mailto:security@mailejoe.io)**. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but generally within a few days.
